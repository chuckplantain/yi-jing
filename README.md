## Yi Jing Consultation

[Yi Jing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching 'Wikipedia Entry') is \
a chinese oracle that is a 'mirror of the present'.

Like all magick, emotional content is very important. If you ask a question \
that you are emotionally connected to, results will be better.

I have only used this once but, the result was very good that one time. I \
will think about adding features that translates hexagrams to english, etc.
